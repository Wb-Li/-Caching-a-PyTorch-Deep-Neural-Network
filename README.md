In this analysis, stocks were filtered based on financial criteria, including a requirement for a launch date exceeding one year and trailing twelve months (TTM) earnings greater than 0. The data was then partitioned into training and testing sets. Input features for a momentum model were derived from the highest price, lowest price, opening price, and closing price over the past four days, with momentum synthesized in various forms. A closely linked fully-connected neural network was constructed to model momentum, particularly associated with a three-day yield. The testing sample's rates of return were computed, incorporating profitability measures and the Sharpe ratio.
